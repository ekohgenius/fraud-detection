# fraud-detection
This project trains a fraud detection classifier for monetary transactions using a number of techniques for anomaly detection (i.e isolation forest and autoencoders) and deploys the model as an API to production using the Heroku server.

## Usage

Edit test.py to contain transaction details as you would like to evaluate or make it read a json file containing transactions.

Run on command line 
```
> python test.py
```
